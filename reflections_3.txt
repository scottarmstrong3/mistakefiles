When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you are working with multiple people on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So you can choose to resolve merge conflicts when you want or so it’s clear when a bug is introduced to your code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones on people’s local repositories that allow people to access the same repository. Clones are straight up copies. Branches are just on the local repository until they are merged with github.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can revert back to it if need be.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Not much would be easier. Combining changes and fixing mistakes would be a lot harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    You can proofread changes before making them official. Master is immediate though.
