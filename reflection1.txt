How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    You could see everything that was changed since there was no bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can revert to old versions if you make mistakes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros are that the code is saved at a logical time and you can add a caption to describe what you changed. cons are having to take time to commit as well as merge conflicts.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because git is used for coding and coding requires multiple that are directly related.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

use them

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because you can revert to where you were before something broke if it doesnâ€™t work.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Pairwise programming projects.
